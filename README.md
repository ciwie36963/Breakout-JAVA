# BreakoutGame - Java

## Description

For our second-year assignment we needed to work out a platform that teachers could use to organize quizzes on a bit like Kahoot. The assignment existed out of 2 parts. A desktop application written in Java and a Web application written in C# / ASP.NET MVC CORE 2.0.
In comparison to the first-year assignment we needed to use database frameworks instead of pure SQL (JPA for Java and Entity Framework for .NET).
The Java application was made to create the quizzes while the .NET application would be used by the students to participate in the quizzes.
This repository houses the Java application.
